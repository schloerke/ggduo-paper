# Journal 

## JCGS
* 15% acceptance rate
* use gpairs paper

## Make topic / paragraph outline
* then fill it in
* then back to intro to match the lit used

# Main ggduo functions

## Regression
* observations
  * leverage value (residuals) vs Coef value
  * influence
  * cooks distance
* control on what to display
* use the broom package

## Time Series
* ts.plot

## Multiple Time Series
* pigs data
  * cranvas::pigs
  * ggobi website as well

## Single plot ggmatrix
* only continuous value data
* extra params
  * color
  * transparency




# Paper
* (< 25 pages including everything)
  * can include things in supplementary location
    * is free to the internet
  * must flow together
    * not many side stories of technical details
    * can put these in appendix section

* (Literature Review)
  * (1 - 2 pages; setup work; get excited; )
  * GGally / ggpairs
    * emerson paper
    * linked scatter plots / cleveland

* Methodology
  * (5-10 pages)
  * (conceptual framework)
  * (guts of the program)

* Examples
  * (<= 5 pages)
  * (breadth of application)
  * CCA
  * Time Series
    * break temporal components
  * Regression
    * marginal model
    * residuals
    * cooks distance
    * (other 'y' sections)
  * Interaction
    * plot.ly
    * Ties back to cleveland's linked scatterplots

* (Future Direction / Discussion)
* (<= 1 pages)
* Discussion
  * pros and cons
  * origin and why it came about
  * what we can not achieve with the ggmatrix / ggduo

* References
